##GLITCH
ICM 2014 Final Project by  
Tommy Payne & Pat Shiu

###PRIORITIES: 
1. map users mouse to mage size not canvas size
2. delay loading image by 2 seconds, have one filter only playing as initial view - then user starts playing with buttons
3. load PNG files for UI, get rid of controlP5
4. name UI buttons clearly/concisely, maybe use icons down the track
5. simplify interaction with UI, isolate the interaction to the buttons only, not mouseX/Y across the canvas
